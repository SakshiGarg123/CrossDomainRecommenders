# CrossDomainRecommenders
# Project Title
Problem Statement
Users express their interests and tastes through ratings, feedbacks, reviews, comments.
We have chosen movies as source domain and books as target domain. 
Keywords -Keywords hold significance because ’The distributional hypothesis’ is employed which suggests that if words meaning have same semantic interpretation then they will have similar distribution and occur in related context.
Genre- Genre is an important index to relate books with movies because there is a possibility that a user likes highly correlated genres.Thus it provides quality recommendations.
